# Music Library ðŸŽ¶

This project implements an online music library with RESTful APIs to manage songs. It allows users to view, add, modify, and delete songs, with additional functionality for pagination and filtering.

## Features

- Get library data with filtering and pagination.
- Retrieve song lyrics with pagination by verses.
- Add a new song with the following JSON format:

```json
{
	"group": "Muse",
	"song": "Supermassive Black Hole"
}
```

- Delete songs from the library.
- Edit song details.

### Requirements

- Go 1.22 and above.

### Compilation

First clone the repository and compile the project:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd ./music-library
go build -o music-library ./cmd
```

## Launch

To start the server, use the following command:

```bash
./music-library
```

### Database

The application stores enriched song details in a PostgreSQL database. The database schema is automatically created via migrations on service startup.

### Logging

Debug and info logs are included throughout the application.

### Configuration

All configuration settings (e.g., database credentials) are loaded from a .env file.

### Swagger API

Swagger documentation is generated for the implemented API.
